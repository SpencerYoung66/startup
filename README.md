## Startup Specification

### Elevator Pitch

Every year at our family Labor Day homemade ice cream contest, we fill out paper slips and write down our votes. This requires people to count the number of votes every year, which is a pain. However, if we had a website to vote on, we could have a website count and store the votes, making it much easier to decide who the winner is. On top of that, we could keep a history of who won what with which flavor. This would make our lives easier and make it possible to reflect on the past winning contestants and flavors.
